Description,"<div></div>
<span style="font-size: 18px;">
Annual median family medical out-of-pocket spending, including premiums, for individuals in the civilian non-institutionalized population. &ldquo;Out-of-pocket&rdquo; (OOP) is the term used to describe the costs of health care that are not covered by health insurance but paid for out of an individual&rsquo;s own resources. These costs include premiums and medical expenses not covered by their medical plan, including copays for doctor and dentist visits, diagnostic tests, prescription medicine, glasses and contacts, and medical supplies.<br />
