### Notes
You can export a list of all the childcare centers in Texas, which have 'capacity' and 'rating'

Requires pulling together data across multiples sources; begin by pulling the list of licensed centers from DFPS (https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Child_Care/Search_Texas_Child_Care/ppFacilitySearchResults.asp); will then need to go to multiple sources to identify whether each has quality accreditation or not:TRS (https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Child_Care/Search_Texas_Child_Care/ppFacilitySearchResults.asp) counts as quality accreditation if TRS 4; NAC (https://www.earlylearningleaders.org/accreditation/search-accredited-program/#!directory) counts if accredited; NAEYC (http://families.naeyc.org/find-quality-child-care) counts if accredited; Montessori (https://amiusa.org/school-locator-2/) and (https://amshq.org/Families/Find-A-School) counts if accredited
