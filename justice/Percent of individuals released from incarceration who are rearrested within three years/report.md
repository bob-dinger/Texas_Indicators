### Notes

Latest number I have is from a Texas report, so we can't get state comparisons. I couldn't find one consecutive year report with all the states. 

Choice of source I think comes down to wanting the comparison or having a reliable update every year for a standard number.

There are a few sources/reports that cover every state, but not every year:

[Here is one from 2018](https://vadoc.virginia.gov/media/1363/vadoc-state-recidivism-comparison-report-2018-12.pdf)

[The sentencing project has one for 2019](https://www.sentencingproject.org/the-facts/#map)
